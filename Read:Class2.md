# Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
CPU that have more core can boost your computer’s performance by running multiple programs at once. CPU’s that have higher speed can execute instructions more efficiently.CPU’s with higher speed is better for gaming although newer games are starting to utilize multiple cores. Typically processors come in quad or hex-cores. 
# What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
By checking the socket of the CPU and motherboard you are able to see which processor is compatible with your motherboard
# What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
You have the option of selecting a hard disk drive or solid state drive when selecting a storage device. SSD’s are typically more expensive and more reliable while HDDs are more cost efficient and can store more data.
# Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
I would say make a checklist of all the component that a computer requires to operate when building a computer. I would also use analogies to explain key parts. For example: A computer hardrive storing data is similar to you writing your notes in a journal. It keeps all the information in tact even when its not in use.

## Thing I want to know more about
How can I build a computer that is specific for high performance media entermainment?
