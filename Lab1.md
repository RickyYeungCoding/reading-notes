# Lab: What is a Computer?
## Overview
Before we can effectively administer virtual machines with our lab kit PC, it’s important to develop a firm grasp of computer hardware components and what role each component plays in supporting the overall performance of the computer. This will allow us to understand the corresponding components represented in both Virtualbox and cloud systems. For example, a computer in the real world such as the lab kit in front of you will be able to process computations faster with a better CPU. Similarly, a virtual CPU resource allocation represented in Virtualbox or a cloud system will directly affect the virtual machine’s clock speeds.
These computer hardware labs will arm you with requisite knowledge and reference experiences to appropriately allocate computer resources in both virtual and physical systems. With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, it’s important to know your system specs!
## Objectives
Today, you open your lab kit PC (personal computer), identify select components, remove them if instructed to, then catalog them for future reference
## Resources
- Lab kit PC
- Precision toolkit
- Anti-static bracelet
## Tasks
Create a well-structured Google Doc that itemizes the internal components of your lab computer. Copy and paste the lab instructions into your Google Doc and use text headings to segment the document to describe each component below. Every section should include a photo, description, and purpose of the component. Be sure to take note of any errors, their solutions and resources used. For items that say EXTRACT, completely disconnect the part from the motherboard and case; photograph it on your table in isolation.
Because you will ultimately be rebuilding this PC, it is critical to carefully follow these directions and carefully document what you did. Take care not to remove components that are not listed below.
- I/O shield
- PCI slots on motherboard
- PCI-Express slots on motherboard
- Processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU) w/ CPU fan
- Motherboard, identify make, model, and specs
- Random Access Memory (RAM) - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
- Hard drive (HDD, 2.5” SSD and/or M.2 SSD) - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
- Chassis Fan - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
- If your PC uses rubber plugs to attach the fan to the chassis instead of metal screws DO NOT EXTRACT. Just photograph it in place.
- CD/DVD-ROM Drive - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
- Power supply - identify make, model, and specs
- Case
Leave the Lab PC disassembled until the next class.
If you have not received your lab kit tower or monitor yet, you may get started by completing the description and purpose requirements and then resubmit the assignment with pictures of your disassembled computer later.
## Submission Instructions
- Name the document according to your course code and assignment.
i.e. seattle-ops-102d33: Lab 04
- Add your name & date at the top of the Google Doc.
- Share your Google Doc so that “Anyone with the link can comment”.
- Paste the link to your Google Doc in the discussion field below and share an observation from your experience in this lab including how long this lab took to complete.

# I/O Shield
**bold text** Description: The component has multiple ports for USB drives and HDMI connectors
**bold text** Purpose: Allows for air flow and protects your inputs and outputs from being damaged
PCI Slots on Motherboard


Description: Flat long rectanglular chips inserted into the motherboard
Purpose: Allows you to attach hardware components such as network cards, modems, sound cards, disk controllers and more

PCI-Express slots



Description: Two distinctly colored slots noticeably smaller than PCI slots
Purpose:  It is used as an interface for motherboard components including graphics, memory, and storage
Random Access Memory (RAM)

Description: 4 Green rectangular chips
Purpose: Ram is used to store information that needs to be used quickly
Make : My technology geeks
Model: 1600 8GB 2Rx8-CA3-33
Specs: 8GB per chip 32GB total
Hard drive

Description: Flat metal component
Purpose: For storing all digital content
Make: Intel   Model: SSDSC2KF256G8  Specs: 256GB
Chassis Fan

Description: Mini black plastic fan attached to the side of the frame
Purpose: It is used to dissipate heat generated from other components 

Instructor told us not to remove the fan because there are rubber plugs





CD/DVD-ROM Drive



Make: HL Data Storage
Model: GH70N
Specs: ROM VER. A101
Description: Solid Metal rectangular tin. Had to unscrew to remove DVD drive from frame.
Purpose: This component of the computer is for inserting a DVD or CD and to read its data.


Power Supply

Make: Dell INc
Model: L265EM-00
Specs: Input - 100-240V Output - +12VA
Description: Solid Metal square tin. Should not remove due to electrical components that may injure oneself.
Purpose: To supply power to all of the other computer components



Case



Description: Large flat square that was easy to remove from the frame of the computer.
Purpose: To protect the interior components of the computer
