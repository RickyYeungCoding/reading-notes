# Lab: What is a Computer?
## Overview
Before we can effectively administer virtual machines with our lab kit PC, it’s important to develop a firm grasp of computer hardware components and what role each component plays in supporting the overall performance of the computer. This will allow us to understand the corresponding components represented in both Virtualbox and cloud systems. For example, a computer in the real world such as the lab kit in front of you will be able to process computations faster with a better CPU. Similarly, a virtual CPU resource allocation represented in Virtualbox or a cloud system will directly affect the virtual machine’s clock speeds.
These computer hardware labs will arm you with requisite knowledge and reference experiences to appropriately allocate computer resources in both virtual and physical systems. With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, it’s important to know your system specs!
